# Frontend Features ‚Äì Job Board App

This document outlines all frontend functionality for the Job Board project. Built using **React + Vite + Tailwind**,

## üîê Authentication (via Auth0)

Authentication is fully managed by **Auth0** using the free Developer Plan (up to 1,000 MAUs). We will not build
a custom auth layer.

### 1. Login / Register (Hosted by Auth0)

- Redirect users to Auth0-hosted login page
- Users sign up or log in with email/password or SSO (Google)
- Frontend receives tokens and stores them securely

### 2. Google SSO

- Enabled through Auth0‚Äôs Identity Provider integration
- Part of the same hosted login flow

### 3. Session Handling

- Frontend stores access tokens via the Auth0 React SDK
- Auto-refresh and access token storage handled internally

### 4. Logout

- Calls `Auth0Auth.signOut()`
- Clears session and redirects back to homepage

## üìö Third-Party Libraries Suggested

## ÔøΩ Opinionated React + TypeScript Stack (Staff Engineer Picks)

| **Category**         | **Chosen Library**                 | **Why?**                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Forms**            | **React Hook Form + Zod**          | Uncontrolled = better perf. Zod = type-safe validation.                  |
| **State Management** | **Redux Toolkit (RTK)**            | RTK Query for caching + minimal boilerplate. Scales better than Context. |
| **Styling**          | **Tailwind CSS**                   | Utility-first = faster dev. No runtime JS = better performance.          |
| **Routing**          | **react-router-dom**               | Standard for SPAs. Supports lazy loading + nested routes.                |
| **Notifications**    | **Sonner**                         | Lighter (~1kB) than react-hot-toast. Smoother animations.                |
| **Data Fetching**    | **TanStack Query**                 | Smarter caching than RTK Query for complex APIs. Auto refetch/retry.     |
| **UI Components**    | **shadcn/ui**                      | Radix-based, unstyled, accessible. Better than MUI for custom designs.   |
| **Drag & Drop**      | **@dnd-kit/core**                  | Modular, performant, and touch-friendly. Replaces react-beautiful-dnd.   |
| **Testing**          | **Vitest + React Testing Library** | Faster than Jest. Native ESM support.                                    |
